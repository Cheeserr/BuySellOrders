# BuySellOrders
 
Interview assignment from Big Xyt done using C#.

I decided to go for Console App for simplicity and speed. Given time I might potentially make it into a Web or Windowed App with proper Forms for creating orders and potentially reading all orders on the go.
Thank you for giving me this opportunity and I am awaiting more challenges! Please let me know if I shall correct something or if I misunderstood some parts of the assignment.

I hope you have a wonderful day and I hope I hear from you soon.

Kind regards
Sergiusz Pietrala
